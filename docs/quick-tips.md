# Quick Tips

Quick Tips are a way to cover basic techniques, questions and procedures without wasting readers' time with a long article. They are also useful building blocks for editors, as they can link to them from other articles and skip going over old ground in every article. 

Here are a few examples of quick tips that have done well:

 - [Quick Tip: Stop Writing Loops and Start Thinking with Maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-stop-writing-loops-start-thinking-with-maps/)
 - [Quick Tip: Get a Homestead Vagrant VM Up and Running](http://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-get-homestead-vagrant-vm-running/)
 - [Mastering Composer â€“ Tips and Tricks](http://www.sitepoint.com/mastering-composer-tips-tricks/)

Always ask your editor whether your pitch may be appropriate for a Quick Tip.

## Topics and Research

Topics should come from your own knowledge of commonly asked questions, or procedures that come up again and again in your articles (installing Node, Sass, Ruby or other tools come to mind). 

They should also come from research into what people are searching for. The best place to find this info is on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Check out the popular questions for your channel's topic and work use those as the basis of a quick tip. (Don't copy the content, obviously.)
